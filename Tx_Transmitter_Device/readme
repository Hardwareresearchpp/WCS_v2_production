# ESP32 Transmitter Firmware (Tx.ino)

## 🛠️ Hardware Compatibility

* *MCU:* ESP32 (tested on 4MB flash)
* *Input:* Push Buttons (configured on 4 GPIOs)
* *Output:* RGB WS2812B LEDs
* *Optional:*

  * Voltage divider for battery monitoring
  * GPIO pin hold for RTC wake
  * Bluetooth configuration enabled when charging



## 🔋 Operation Modes

* *Normal Mode:* Uses Wi-Fi and server sync
* *WCS Mode:* Offline peer-to-peer ESP-NOW

Modes are auto-detected based on EEPROM settings or can be manually configured via Bluetooth.



## 🚀 Key Features

* ESP-NOW for low-latency button transmission
* Wi-Fi HTTP sync with cloud/server
* Bluetooth-based configuration (only during charge)
* EEPROM-based storage of configurations
* OTA firmware updates via GitHub
* LED color codes for system state and error tracing
* Smart deep sleep to preserve battery


## 🔧 Flashing Instructions

1. Open in Arduino IDE / PlatformIO
2. Select **ESP32 Dev Module**
3. Set **Partition Scheme:** Minimal SPIFFS (1.2MB app / 1.5MB FS)
4. Upload `Tx.ino`

## 🌐 OTA Update Support
OTA update is enabled for this firmware. On boot, the device checks a hosted version file and downloads the latest binary if a new version is available.


## 📲 Bluetooth Configuration (During Charging Only)

To update configuration without flashing:

1. Power device while charging.
2. Pair with Bluetooth via Serial Terminal app.
3. Send authorized key.
4. Set parameters like SSID, passwords, gateway IP, LED count, and mode.

## 💤 Power Management

* Auto deep sleep when idle (no interaction)
* Configurable sleep duration
* Wake-up on button press or charger connection
* Voltage monitoring for battery % (customizable)
